		<h2>My Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad, Blog Page...About OCD</h2>

		<h3>Beginnings</h3>

			<p>Nobody told me that becoming a mental health blogger would be easy. But somewhere along the way of devouring other blogs and deriving enjoyment and benefit from their content, I got around to the idea that slapping my own thoughts down on the screen and pushing the publish button couldn’t be all that difficult. I mean, right? Four drafts in on this first post and I’m laughing at me now too, don’t you worry. But pushing through is mandatory folks, because I’m on a sizeable mission and with social responsibility weighing heavy on my conscience (see 5 Reasons I Became a Mental Health Blogger), this isn’t a question of whether or not I can blog, it’s the fact that I should. . .I must blog.

		<h3>Fade into view and enter: My OCD.</h3>

			<p>If I’m the protagonist in my little hero’s journey here to blog with a mission, then OCD is the deceptive, conniving motherfucker out to see all my efforts towards contributing to world betterment end up as nothing more than docx files on my desktop

			<p>To explain, let me give you a closer look at our bad guy’s profile here.You see, I don’t have a typical case of OCD. In most cases, the obsessions occur mentally, of course, but then the compulsions carried out to quell the obsessions are typically observable by another person (i.e. person washes hands raw, walks back to check the door lock eleven times, etc.)</p>

			<p>I, on the other hand, have what is referred to as perfectionism and “just right” OCD. And even though that sounds fairly innocuous–as if I’m a savvy job interviewee trying to spin a good trait as a flaw–my personal brand of OCD has brought me to the edge of my sanity Howard Hughes style, or, balled up in the fetal position on the bathroom floor, on more occasions than I care to recall.</p>

			<p>With perfectionism/“just right” OCD, all my compulsions are carried out mentally via endless and agonizing questioning, reviewing, and repeating until whatever it is I’m doing feels a very certain way. (To fully illustrate will be a whole other post, trust and believe. For now, just a imagine being on a dark, twisted mental merry-go-round that you can’t seem to get off of without incurring sheer terror and/or panic.)</p>

		<h3>Now here’s the plot twist.</h3>

			<p>My personal greatest trigger for obsessing and carrying out said mental compulsions? My absolute kryptonite? My OCD Achilles’ heel? Oh you know, just the very thing I love most…the thing I’m doing here.</p>

			<p>W R I T I N G. Because. . .</p>

			<p>What if I haven’t told my story chronologically? Even if I do, what if the reader can’t follow me?! (I can’t even follow me in my own head half the time!) What if I leave something pertinent out? What if I put something irrelevant in? What if my writing comes off as scatterbrained or worse, elementary?! What if I use a word incorrectly? What if my blogging tone isn’t well developed yet and I bore my readers away? What if I post something prematurely, perhaps a draft that needs one more good revision? Ad infinitum.</p>

			<p>Anyway. Surely you must be wondering, if writing is my greatest “trigger” (as they say in OCD-speak), then what brings me here, to this moment, churning out these words while I battle my cerebral demons?</p>

		<h3>Three words my friends. . . Exposure. Response. Therapy.</h3>

			<p>Oh yes. This gal has entered treatment with a bonafide OCD specialist and she’s coming in on me guns-a-blazing with the CBT and ERP.

			<p>For those of you unfamiliar with ERP, the basic premise is to progressively expose the patient to situations that cause their obsession without allowing them to carry out their compulsions. Over time, the hope is that the patient “habituates” to the triggering situation, lessening the obsession and the need to perform the associated compulsions. Layman speak: do the shit you’re scared of anyway in small and then increasingly sized doses.</p>

		<h3>Monday and Mission Mindlift.</h3>

			<p>Monday was my first day in therapy, and I’ve been tasked with the goal of exposing myself to my triggering situation (writing) for two hours per day. And because I have a sparkling tendency towards the downright masochistic, I thought what better way to make this a productively painful thing and channel it into something purposeful than to chronicle my journey and create a space where others can come to find material that helps to lift their minds out of the muck? Perhaps my story, or the other content I plan to share here at Mission Mindlift, will do just that, lift someone out of the black hole they’re in even if just for a precious moment. Perhaps the articles I write and share in this space while I’m exposing myself to my triggermonsters and working to lift my mind out of the darkness will reach somebody and help pull them to the surface long enough to remind them there is light out there. Brilliant, beautiful, soul-satisfying and mindlifting light</p>
